Changes

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>/say and death messages can be shown in the main channel, if enabled in the config</li>
<li>IRC modes now have configurable prefixes and suffixes (set in messages.yml). You will also have to update lines in messages.yml (like irc-message) to include %PREFIX% and %SUFFIX% accordingly<li>
<li>Regex filter for what messages show in the staff channel (these must include .+ on the end)</li>
<li>Say and death message colouring can be toggled in the config (note: /say is not natively capable of custom colour codes, and will therefore remove them)</li>
<li>Sending messages from ingame to IRC shows contents</li>
<li>PluginMetrics - if you do not want this, enable opt-out in plugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml</li>
<li>Added some new debug codes for messages you normally see - if something goes on, we need them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with 1.5.1 (not that 1.0 wasn't)</li>
<li>Formatting codes now work everywhere</li>
<li>When a player is kicked, it now shows a kick message instead of a disconnect with 'Kick' as the reason</li>
<li>Sometimes running commands in the staff channel or kicking a player from IRC would freeze the server - this will no longer happen</li>
<li>The staff channel now has full console permissions</li>
<li>The player list now uses Minecraft colour codes</li>
<li>The 'ingame suffix' is no longer shown to players when you mention them - this can be disabled in the config</li>
<li>Players are no longer given multiple IRC modes - it was unnecessary, but if you prefer the old functionality edit the config</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> If this is the first time you are trying this plugin, be sure to copy over the provided config.yml and messages.yml, as they do not correctly generate yet.


Known Issues

<ul>

BukkitIRCd
=============

### Working download now available at [Our Jenkins](http://ci.wma.im).

This plugin was [originally](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/bukkitircd) by Jdbye. As he hasn't touched it in months, we decided to make some edits of our own.

What we are trying to do is continue the work of Jdbye. We are starting off with a few minor fixes that we've noticed are needed for this plugin to continue functioning, then will continually add features and support for future versions of Bukkit.

If you know how to code in Java, then by all means take a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/nathanblaney/BukkitIRCd/issues) page and submit a Pull Request with code additions as required. We're going to need all the support and teamwork we can get.

### Plugin Developers

* Mu5tank05 (Nathan)
* WizardCM (Matt G)

If you'd like to join the team, let us know and we'll happily add you.

#### Developer Thanks

* peerau - uploaded BukkitIRCd to Github so we wouldn't have to
* SonarBeserk - fixed up all the old permissions for us, removed old class files
* jkcclemens - for letting us use the 'colorize' code that allowed us to change from section signs to ampersands in the messages.yml, among other things

### Extra Notes

This development is mainly for the benifit of the [Worldwide Minecraft Alliance](http://wma.im), an Australian multi-feature server hosted in Sydney, Australia. However, if you'd like to use the plugin on your own server, then by all means go ahead.

### Required for Compiling

After looking at the [.classpath](https://github.com/nathanblaney/BukkitIRCd/blob/master/.classpath), it is clear the following files are required.

* [Bukkit](http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/) (not to be confused with [CraftBukkit](http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/), the server wrapper)
* [Dynmap API](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/dynmap/files/82-dynmap-api-v1-1/)
 
### Licensing
